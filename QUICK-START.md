## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Same Time, Every Day**: Consistency builds habits
   - Morning: Great for setting intentions
   - Evening: Perfect for unwinding
   - Lunch break: Nice midday reset

2. **Start Small**: 10 minutes is perfect
   - Don't overcommit at first
   - Build the habit before extending time
   - Consistency matters more than duration

3. **Track Immediately**: Don't wait until later
   - Mark completion right after practice
   - Note how you feel while it's fresh
   - This reinforces the positive habit

4. **Be Kind to Yourself**: Missing a day happens
   - Don't break the chain, but if you do...
   - Start again the next day
   - Focus on progress, not perfection

5. **Review Regularly**: Weekly reviews keep you on track
   - Celebrate your wins
   - Learn from challenges
   - Adjust your approach as needed

## 📝 Creating Tomorrow's Plan

Use the template at `daily/TEMPLATE-daily-plan.md`:

```bash
cp daily/TEMPLATE-daily-plan.md daily/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
```

Then edit with tomorrow's date and priorities.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Q: I forgot to practice today. What should I do?**  
A: No problem! Mark it as incomplete in your log, reflect on why, and commit to practicing tomorrow. The goal is progress, not perfection.

**Q: I only had 5 minutes today, not 10. Does it count?**  
A: Yes! Some practice is better than none. Note the actual time and celebrate showing up.

**Q: How do I add more goals?**  
A: Add them to `goals/master-goals.md` under the appropriate category, then incorporate them into your daily plans.

**Q: Can I change the 10-minute duration?**  
A: Absolutely! Update your goal in `goals/master-goals.md` if you want to practice longer (but start with 10 to build the habit first).

## 🎊 Celebrate Your Commitment!

You've taken the first step by setting up this system. Now the real journey begins. Remember:

> "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." - Aristotle

Your daily 10-minute TaiChi practice is a gift you're giving to yourself. Stay consistent, track your progress, and watch the benefits compound over time.

**Start today. Start now. Your future self will thank you!** 🧘✨
