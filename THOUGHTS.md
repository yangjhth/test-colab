## Reflections on Balance

**Energy Management:**
- Tree planting needs a push of activation energy
- 3D printing can be sustained with regular small sessions
- Crabbing/fishing is seasonal and event-based

**Time Reality Check:**
- 3D printing: 2-4 hours/week feels sustainable
- Tree planting: Intense for 2-4 weeks, then minimal
- Crabbing/fishing: Quarterly full-day events

**What Excites Me Most:**
- 3D printing: The long-term creative potential
- Tree planting: The environmental legacy
- Crabbing/fishing: Family bonding and memories

**What Scares Me:**
- Tree planting: Just getting started (but I know once I start it'll flow)
- 3D printing: The long timeline (years), staying consistent
- Crabbing/fishing: Logistics coordination with family schedules
