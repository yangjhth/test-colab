## 🌳 Pillar 2: Tree Planting

**Type:** Environmental Stewardship & Long-term Investment  
**Frequency:** One-time planting, ongoing maintenance  
**Timeline:** Plant within next 3-6 months, maintain for years

### Current Status
- ✅ Trees ready to plant
- ✅ Areas planned and identified
- 🔄 Need activation energy to start planting
- 🔄 Then water/fertilize maintenance

### Success Criteria
- Plant all ready trees in designated areas
- Establish sustainable watering and fertilizing routine
- Watch trees grow and thrive over the years
- Create a legacy of environmental contribution

### Milestones
- [ ] **Week 1**: Schedule specific planting day(s) on calendar
- [ ] **Week 1**: Gather all planting tools and materials
- [ ] **Week 2**: Plant first batch of trees (break into manageable sessions)
- [ ] **Week 3**: Plant remaining trees
- [ ] **Month 1**: Establish watering schedule and routine
- [ ] **Month 2**: First fertilizing session
- [ ] **Ongoing**: Monthly maintenance check-ins

### Next Actions
1. **ACTIVATION STEP**: Block 4 hours on calendar THIS WEEK for planting
2. Inventory planting tools needed (shovel, gloves, mulch, stakes, etc.)
3. Check weather forecast for optimal planting conditions
4. Break planting into small sessions (2-3 trees at a time)
5. Set up simple watering reminder system (phone alarm or calendar)

### Resources Needed
- Planting tools (shovel, gloves, mulch, stakes)
- Water source or watering system
- Fertilizer supply
- Physical energy (plan for early morning or cooler times)

### Motivation Boost
Once planted, you can "mostly rest and enjoy" watching them grow. The hard part is just getting started!

## 🖨️ Pillar 3: 3D Printing Art (Ultimate Side Gig)

**Type:** Creative Expression & Technical Mastery  
**Frequency:** Ongoing incremental progress  
**Timeline:** Multi-year journey (Years 1-3+)

### Current Status
- 🔄 Researched some 3D printer candidates
- 🔄 Plan to start with local library printers
- 💡 Leverage semiconductor photonics IC fabrication knowledge
- 🎯 Eventual goal: Combine technique mastery with art and spiritual expression

### Success Criteria
- Build expertise in 3D printing workflows and techniques
- Create a smooth, repeatable creative process
- Produce meaningful art pieces aligned with inner values
- Potentially develop into sustainable side business
- Make consistent incremental progress over years

### Strategic Approach (Graduated Plan)
This pillar follows a deliberate progression from exploration to mastery:

#### Phase 1: Exploration & Learning (Months 1-6)
**Goal:** Get hands-on experience with minimal investment

- [ ] Visit local library 3D printers (multiple sessions)
- [ ] Try different printing technologies (FDM, SLA, etc.)
- [ ] Print simple test objects to understand basics
- [ ] Join local maker community or 3D printing group
- [ ] Document observations and questions
- [ ] Identify which printer type aligns with goals

#### Phase 2: Workflow Development (Months 7-12)
**Goal:** Establish systematic creative process

- [ ] Develop design-to-print workflow
- [ ] Learn 3D modeling software (Blender, Fusion 360, etc.)
- [ ] Apply photonics fabrication knowledge to precision work
- [ ] Create reference library of successful prints
- [ ] Build understanding of materials and their properties
- [ ] Experiment with post-processing techniques

#### Phase 3: Equipment Investment (Year 2)
**Goal:** Own the tools for independent creation

- [ ] Make informed printer purchase based on Phase 1-2 learnings
- [ ] Set up dedicated workspace
- [ ] Establish safety protocols
- [ ] Build material inventory
- [ ] Create maintenance routine

#### Phase 4: Technical Mastery (Year 2-3)
**Goal:** Refine technique and troubleshooting skills

- [ ] Master printer calibration and optimization
- [ ] Develop expertise in complex multi-part prints
- [ ] Build portfolio of technical achievements
- [ ] Experiment with advanced materials
- [ ] Document learnings and best practices

#### Phase 5: Artistic Expression (Year 3+)
**Goal:** Apply art and spiritual thinking to creations

- [ ] Integrate personal artistic vision
- [ ] Create meaningful pieces aligned with values
- [ ] Explore spiritual/philosophical themes in work
- [ ] Share work with community
- [ ] Develop side gig potential

### Next Actions (Start Here!)
1. **THIS WEEK**: Call or visit local library to schedule 3D printer orientation
2. Create a simple observation journal for learning notes
3. Research local maker spaces or 3D printing meetups
4. Watch 2-3 beginner tutorials on 3D printing basics
5. Sketch or write down initial art ideas (no pressure, just brainstorming)

### Resources Needed
- Library card / maker space access
- Learning time (2-4 hours/week initially)
- Notebook for observations
- Eventually: 3D modeling software (many free options)
- Eventually: Personal printer ($200-$2000 depending on type)

### Unique Advantage
Your semiconductor photonics IC fabrication background gives you:
- Understanding of precision manufacturing
- Familiarity with CAD and design tools
- Knowledge of material properties
- Systematic troubleshooting approach
- Patience for iterative refinement

### Inspiration & Vision
This is your "ultimate side gig aligned with inner value" - a multi-year journey that combines:
- Technical mastery (satisfying for the engineer in you)
- Creative expression (feeding your artistic soul)
- Spiritual exploration (meaningful personal growth)
- Potential income (sustainable side business)

## Balancing the Three Pillars

### Time Allocation Strategy
- **Crabbing/Fishing**: Quarterly focus (4x/year, full-day events)
- **Tree Planting**: Intense startup (2-4 weeks), then minimal maintenance
- **3D Printing**: Consistent incremental progress (2-4 hours/week)

### Energy Management
- **High Energy Required**: Tree planting startup, first crabbing trips
- **Medium Energy**: 3D printing learning and creation
- **Low Energy (Enjoyment)**: Tree maintenance, established fishing routine

### Integration Opportunities
- Document 3D printing journey while waiting for trees to grow
- Use 3D printing to create custom fishing/crabbing accessories
- Print plant markers or garden art for tree areas
- Create nature-inspired 3D art based on outdoor experiences
