## 2026-02-03

### Three Fun Pillars Initiative
Excited to integrate my Three Fun Pillars into the daily planning system! These represent the joyful, creative, and family-oriented aspects of life that bring meaning and fun.

**Related Goals**: Fun & Recreation → Crabbing/Fishing, Tree Planting, 3D Printing Art

**Key Insights**:
- **Crabbing/Fishing**: Gear is ready - the barrier is coordination, not preparation
- **Tree Planting**: Need to commit energy for initial planting, then maintenance is lighter
- **3D Printing**: Long-term vision is clear - start local, learn, buy equipment, master, then integrate spirituality

**Next Steps**: 
- Begin with small actions on each pillar this week
- Don't try to do everything at once - progress over perfection
- Track which pillar needs attention each day

---

### TaiChi Practice Goal
Starting a daily practice of TaiChi - 10 minutes per day. This is about building consistency and creating a sustainable wellness routine.
